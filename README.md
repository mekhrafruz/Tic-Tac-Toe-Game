Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This program is the simple version of tic-tac-toe game implemented by using JavaFx, Scene Builder. There are two playes who press 9 button one after another and it is displaying two versions: x and o. One playe would be for x and another would be for 0. The one who would have his values (x or 0) in a row, in a column or in the diagonal will win the game. There is also a reset button which will refresh the application and the users can start from the beggining. 

The user needs to run the program HelloController.java and the window with the buttons would appear there. Then, as was mentioned above, one player would press button which will show one value, then another user would press another button and it will show the second value. They will repeat these actions one by one until one of them win or both would fail. After they can restart the game by the pressing the button below.
