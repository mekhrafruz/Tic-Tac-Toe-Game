Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This program is the simple version of tic-tac-toe game implemented by using JavaFx, Scene Builder. There are two playes who press the button (9) one after another; it displays two versions: x and o. One player would be for x, another for 0. The one who would have his values (x or 0) in a row, in a column or in the diagonal, wins the game. There is also a reset button which will refresh the application so that the users can start from the beggining. 

The user needs to run the program HelloController.java and the window with the buttons would appear. Next, as mentioned above, one player shall press the button which will show one value, and another user would press another button, so it will show the second value. The users repeat these actions one by one until one of them wins or both fail. After they can restart the game by the pressing the button below.
